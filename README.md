# Movies
You can look up any movie or TV show and you're given
the poster, ratings across different sites, the plot,
and other info such as the genre


## Usage
Type the movie/TV show you want to find into the search bar
and click it to get all of the relevant information

## Contributors
We used 2 APIs to build this web page:
1. The OMDB API which was used to fetch the ratings from the 
different sites
2. The Movie Database Alternative was also used to fetch the title, poster, genre, and the related movies
